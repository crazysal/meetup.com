 an nlp task comparison by simultaneously solving the verification task (If a sample belongs to the certain group )  using three unique approaches :  pgm method(bayesian nets/ markov chains),  simple machine learning (pos tagging, word2vec feature count etc),  a deep learning method (rnn, lstm)
# Deep LSTM siamese network for text similarity

It is a tensorflow based implementation of deep siamese LSTM network to capture phrase/sentence similarity using character embeddings.

This code provides architecture for learning two kinds of tasks:

- Phrase similarity using char level embeddings [1]

- Sentence similarity using word level embeddings [2]

For both the tasks mentioned above it uses a multilayer siamese LSTM network and euclidian distance based contrastive loss to learn input pair similairty.

# Capabilities
Given adequate training pairs, this model can learn Semantic as well as structural similarity. For eg:

**Phrases :**
- International Business Machines = I.B.M
- Synergy Telecom = SynTel
- Beam inc = Beam Incorporate
- Sir J J Smith = Johnson Smith
- Alex, Julia = J Alex
- James B. D. Joshi	= James Joshi
- James Beaty, Jr. = Beaty

For phrases, the model learns **character based embeddings** to identify structural/syntactic similarities.

**Sentences :**
- He is smart = He is a wise man.
- Someone is travelling countryside = He is travelling to a village.
- She is cooking a dessert = Pudding is being cooked.
- Microsoft to acquire Linkedin â‰  Linkedin to acquire microsoft

(More examples Ref: semEval dataset)

For Sentences, the model uses **pre-trained word embeddings** to identify semantic similarities.

Categories of pairs, it can learn as similar:
- Annotations
- Abbreviations
- Extra words
- Similar semantics
- Typos
- Compositions
- Summaries

# Training Data
